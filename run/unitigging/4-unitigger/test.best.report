BEST EDGE FILTERING
-------------------
At graph threshold 0.0000%, reads:
  available to have edges:         1820
  with at least one edge:          1820

At max threshold 0.0000%, reads:  (not computed)
  available to have edges:            0
  with at least one edge:             0

At tight threshold 0.0000%, reads with:
  both edges below error threshold:      1820  (80.00% minReadsBest threshold = 1456)
  one  edge  above error threshold:         0
  both edges above error threshold:         0
  at least one edge:                     1820

At loose threshold 0.0000%, reads with:
  both edges below error threshold:      1820  (80.00% minReadsBest threshold = 1456)
  one  edge  above error threshold:         0
  both edges above error threshold:         0
  at least one edge:                     1820


INITIAL EDGES
-------- ----------------------------------------
     180 reads are contained
    8002 reads have no best edges (singleton)
       2 reads have only one best edge (spur) 
                2 are mutual best
    1816 reads have two best edges 
                0 have one mutual best edge
             1816 have two mutual best edges


FINAL EDGES
-------- ----------------------------------------

                2 are mutual best
    1816 reads have two best edges 
                0 have one mutual best edge
             1816 have two mutual best edges


EDGE FILTERING
-------- ------------------------------------------
       0 reads are ignored
